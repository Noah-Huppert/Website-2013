Maker Faire is attended by approximately 40,000 attendees. My exhibit is called <i>Motion Controlled Maronets</i>. I am using the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> as well as <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> in this exibit. The Leap Motion is a motion control device for the personal computer, with tracking reaching speeds of 200 frames per second and tracking accurate up to 1/100th of a millimeter the Leap is an amazing piece of technological magic. Unity is a 3D graphics engine that allows you to write scripts in a variety of different languages and import almost any 3D format. Unity also happens to have a free version which is very convenient for students such as myself. Using the palm tracking data from the Leap Motion combined with some scripting in Unity I was able to make a marionette demo. In this demo strings are attached to the legs and head much like a real marionette.

<strong><i>The more technical explanation:</i></strong>
<br>
The first thing I did in this program is parent the real life palm position of the persons hand to a object representing a hand. This would make is so when you move your hand left or right, so would your virtual hand, the same applies for pitch, roll, and yaw. One of the problems with doing this in Unity was that Unity doesn't have any strings. This means that you have to use joints in Unity. The only problem is that because of the way a ragdoll in Unity is setup you can't simply attach the joints to the virtual palm representation and the ragdoll, if you did instead of moving a leg up when you tilt your hand left the whole character will rotate left. To fix this I ended up creating 3 separate smaller cubes that are parented to the virtual palm representation. I programed them so when the hand tilted to the left the cubes would individually move up or down to simulate the palm moving and the same for every other direction. I then attached the respective joints to each box and a marionette demo was born.</div></div>
